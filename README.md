# WOTR_WoljifRomanceMod

Follow the full romance path for Woljif Jefto that should have been in the game to begin with. At last you can give the tiefling the love he deserves, but winning his heart won't be easy...
The romance is available for both male and female characters, and begins in Act 3. It's a very slow burn, but if you're patient with him, you can set his heart alight. Be aware that like official owlcat romances, this romance path contains camping events, command room events, and in-base dialogs!

## How to install

1. Download and install [Unity Mod Manager](https://github.com/newman55/unity-mod-manager), make sure it is at least version 0.23.0
2. Run Unity Mod Manger and set it up to find Wrath of the Righteous
3. Download the Woljif Romance Mod
4. Install the mod by dragging the zip file from step 5 into the Unity Mod Manager window under the Mods tab
